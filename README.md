# Qubi-TS
A lightweight Quantum Computing Simulation Library written in TypeScript

You can create qubits and qubit registers and apply gates to them to simulate a quantum computer.

Example: Generate a random number using a Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG):

const rand: bit = qrng(); // Returns 0 or 1
