/**
 * The Swap Test algorithm determines if two qubits are similar or different by indirect measurement.
 * It does not actually measure the qubits, but it uses a trick to return a measurement probability
 * that tells us how similar or different the unknown given qubits are.
 * Two qubits are maximally different if their states are orthogonal (example: ket(0) and ket(1)).
 * @return A value near 0.5 means, that the two qubits are very different. A value near 1.0 means they
 * are very similar.
